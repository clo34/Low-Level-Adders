# Low-Level-Adders
Various adders implemented with systemVerilog


SystemVerilog Adder Modules
This repository contains implementations of the following modules written in SystemVerilog:

Full Adder: A simple 1-bit adder that performs the addition of two bits with a carry input.
Ripple Carry Adder (RCA): A multi-bit adder built by cascading multiple full adders to add two binary numbers.
32-bit Ripple Carry Adder (32-bit RCA): A specific implementation of the Ripple Carry Adder that adds two 32-bit numbers.
